# MAD-OUTCOME
I successfully developed an exercise detection app, Yoga Vision, and presented it at a prestigious project expo at Saveetha College, earning a certificate of achievement. This innovative project utilized MediaPipe for body movement tracking and a TensorFlow Lite model to detect exercises and count repetitions accurately. Developed in Java using Android Studio, the app provides an engaging and user-friendly experience, showcasing practical applications of AI in fitness. This recognition highlights my ability to integrate AI technologies into real-world solutions, reinforcing my commitment to creating impactful and innovative applications.
